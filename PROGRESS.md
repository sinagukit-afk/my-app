# Sinag Ukit BMS — Build Progress

## Phase Log

### Phase 0 — Project Audit — 2026-06-30
- What was built: Audit completed, PROGRESS.md created.
- Key files/locations:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser-side Supabase client (createBrowserClient)
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts` — server-side Supabase client (createServerClient, reads/writes cookies)
  - `proxy.ts` — session-refresh helper; has the correct middleware shape but is named `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`, so Next.js does NOT load it as middleware. Token refresh at the edge is currently non-functional.
  - `app/layout.tsx` — root layout
  - `app/page.tsx` — landing page; redirects authenticated users to /dashboard
  - `app/login/page.tsx` + `app/login/actions.ts` — email/password login form and server action
  - `app/logout/actions.ts` — sign-out server action
  - `app/auth/update-password/page.tsx` — client-side password reset form
  - `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — dashboard shell; auth guard (redirects to /login if no user); fetches profile role; inline nav with Sales / Inventory / Incoming links
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — sales dashboard (receipt_line_items query)
  - `app/dashboard/inventory/page.tsx` — inventory levels table
  - `app/dashboard/incoming/page.tsx` — incoming items data fetch
  - `app/dashboard/incoming/IncomingItemForm.tsx` — client form component
  - `app/dashboard/incoming/actions.ts` — addIncomingItem server action
  - `supabase/*.sql` — raw SQL migration files (4 files; kept for reference)
- Notes for next phase: Removal list for Phase 1 is:
  1. `components/Header.tsx` — never imported anywhere; dead code
  2. `components/Footer.tsx` — never imported anywhere; dead code
  3. `public/file.svg` — Next.js scaffold asset, not referenced in the app
  4. `public/globe.svg` — Next.js scaffold asset, not referenced in the app
  5. `public/next.svg` — Next.js scaffold asset, not referenced in the app
  6. `public/vercel.svg` — Next.js scaffold asset, not referenced in the app
  7. `public/window.svg` — Next.js scaffold asset, not referenced in the app
  8. `README.md` — default Next.js boilerplate README, not project-specific documentation
  - **Note — NOT proposed for removal yet:** `proxy.ts` is currently disconnected (not wired as middleware), but it contains the correct session-refresh logic. Recommend renaming it to `middleware.ts` in a future phase rather than deleting it.

### Phase 1 — Project Foundation — 2026-06-30
- What was built: Removed 8 scaffold/dead-code files; created clean folder skeleton for future modules; `npm run build` passes with zero errors and zero TypeScript errors.
- Key files/locations: Deleted `components/Header.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`, `public/*.svg` (5 files), `README.md`; created `components/ui/`, `lib/types/`, `lib/utils/` (each with `.gitkeep`).
- Notes for next phase: Login flow and all existing routes are untouched. `proxy.ts` still exists but is not wired as middleware — Phase 2 should rename it to `middleware.ts` to activate session refresh. New folders are empty placeholders ready for module code.

### Phase 2 — Design System & Providers — 2026-06-30
- What was built: Global CSS design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows); `cn()` utility; 9 UI components (Button, Card, Input, Badge, Dialog, Skeleton, Container, Section, PageHeader); 5 providers (ThemeProvider functional, RoleProvider/PermissionProvider/NotificationProvider/AIProvider placeholders); root layout updated with full provider tree.
- Key files/locations: `app/globals.css` (tokens), `lib/utils/cn.ts`, `components/ui/` (9 files), `components/providers/` (6 files including index), `app/layout.tsx` (providers wired).
- Dependencies added: `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`.
- Notes for next phase: All components are plain Tailwind CSS variables — no `tailwind.config.js` needed (Tailwind v4). ThemeProvider sets `data-theme` / `.dark` on `<html>` — dark mode CSS overrides can hook into that. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 3 — Application Shell — 2026-06-30
- What was built: `AppShell` client component with collapsible left sidebar, top header (app title + user info + sign out), breadcrumb bar, and scrollable main content area; dashboard layout updated to use AppShell (server auth guard passes user/role as props + `logout` server action); dashboard page replaced with welcome message.
- Key files/locations: `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` (new), `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` (rewritten), `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (replaced with welcome).
- Notes for next phase: Sidebar nav items include placeholder routes (`/dashboard/sales`) that don't exist yet — Phase 4 should add real module pages. Breadcrumb derives labels from URL segments; pages can override with their own `<PageHeader>`. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 4 — Navigation Framework — 2026-06-30
- What was built: Rewrote `AppShell` sidebar nav with expandable group (Operations → Inventory, Purchasing, Orders), per-item inline SVG icons, active-route highlighting, and auto-open of the group containing the current route; created 6 stub pages for all new routes.
- Key files/locations: `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` (rewritten); `app/dashboard/purchasing/page.tsx`, `orders/page.tsx`, `finance/page.tsx`, `analytics/page.tsx`, `administration/page.tsx`, `account/page.tsx` (new stubs).
- Notes for next phase: All nav routes exist and build. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`. Existing `/dashboard/incoming` page is still reachable but not in the new nav — decide whether to keep, rename, or fold into Purchasing/Orders.

### Phase 5 — Dashboard — 2026-06-30
- What was built: Full dashboard page with 7 widgets — 4 KPI stat cards (Today's Sales, Monthly Revenue, Pending Orders, Inventory Value), Recent Activity feed, Low Stock Items list, and Quick Actions bar; all mock data, no real DB queries.
- Key files/locations: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (rewritten, client component).
- Notes for next phase: All widgets use design-system components (Card, Badge, Button, PageHeader). Quick Actions link to existing stub routes. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 6a — Module Stubs: Operations — 2026-06-30
- What was built: 10 stub pages for Operations sub-modules (Inventory ×4, Purchasing ×2, Orders ×4); sidebar nav expanded with a `NavSubGroup` type that renders labelled sections inside the Operations group.
- Key files/locations: `app/dashboard/inventory/{incoming,adjustment,stock-movement,suppliers}/page.tsx`; `app/dashboard/purchasing/{purchase-orders,receiving}/page.tsx`; `app/dashboard/orders/{quotes,order-list,production-queue,completed}/page.tsx`; `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` (nav types + render updated).
- Notes for next phase: Existing `/dashboard/inventory`, `/dashboard/purchasing`, `/dashboard/orders` parent pages still exist but are no longer in the sidebar nav — decide whether to repurpose them as section overviews or remove. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 6b — Module Stubs: Finance & Analytics — 2026-06-30
- What was built: 8 stub pages for Finance (Income, Expenses, Cash Flow, Profit & Loss) and Analytics (Sales Report, Inventory Report, Production Report, Financial Report); both sections converted from flat nav items to expandable `NavGroup` entries in the sidebar.
- Key files/locations: `app/dashboard/finance/{income,expenses,cash-flow,profit-loss}/page.tsx`; `app/dashboard/analytics/{sales-report,inventory-report,production-report,financial-report}/page.tsx`; `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` (Finance and Analytics nav entries updated).
- Notes for next phase: Existing `/dashboard/finance` and `/dashboard/analytics` parent pages still exist but are no longer nav items — same decision needed as for Operations parents. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 6c — Module Stubs: Administration & Account — 2026-06-30
- What was built: 4 stub pages — Administration (Users, Roles, Activity Logs) and Account (Profile); both sections converted from flat nav items to expandable NavGroup entries; all 22 sidebar links across the full app now resolve to real, rendering pages.
- Key files/locations: `app/dashboard/administration/{users,roles,activity-logs}/page.tsx`; `app/dashboard/account/profile/page.tsx`; `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` (Administration and Account nav entries updated).
- Notes for next phase: Orphaned parent pages (`/dashboard/administration`, `/dashboard/account`, and the Operations/Finance/Analytics parents) are still reachable by direct URL but not linked from the nav — Phase 7 should decide whether to repurpose or remove them. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.

### Phase 7 — Shared Business Components — 2026-06-30
- What was built: 9 reusable business components (StatCard, PlaceholderCard, EmptyState, SearchBar, FilterBar, NotificationBell, UserMenu, Breadcrumb, DataToolbar); all client-side where needed, no real data connections.
- Key files/locations: `components/business/` — one file per component plus `index.ts` barrel export.
- Notes for next phase: Components are ready to drop into module pages. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`. Orphaned parent stub pages still unresolved.

### Phase 8 — Reusable Forms & Tables — 2026-06-30
- What was built: 7 form input components (TextArea, NumberInput, CurrencyInput, DatePicker, Select/Dropdown, Toggle, Checkbox) plus a fully-featured DataTable (search, column sorting, pagination, empty state, loading skeleton rows); existing `Input` from Phase 2 covers TextInput.
- Key files/locations: `components/ui/textarea.tsx`, `number-input.tsx`, `currency-input.tsx`, `date-picker.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `toggle.tsx`, `checkbox.tsx`, `data-table.tsx` — all use design-system CSS tokens.
- Notes for next phase: All components are drop-in ready for module pages. DataTable is generic (`DataTable<T>`) — pass typed `columns` + `data` arrays. CurrencyInput defaults to ₱ symbol, configurable via `currency` prop. `proxy.ts` still needs renaming to `middleware.ts`.
