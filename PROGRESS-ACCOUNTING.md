# PROGRESS-ACCOUNTING.md

Tracking file for the Accounting Module workstream only. Kept separate from the
core BMS `PROGRESS.md` so phase numbers don't collide between the two build
threads. Full spec/instructions for each phase: see
`Accounting-Module-Phase1-5-ClaudeCode-Instructions.md`.

Migration files share one global sequence with core BMS migrations
(`0013_...` onward) — only the phase *labels* below are namespaced to this
workstream.

## Status

| Phase | Description | Status | Migration(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACCT-1 | Chart of Accounts | Done | `0013_accounting_chart_of_accounts` | |
| ACCT-2 | Journal core (`journal_entries`, `post_journal_entry()`) | Done | `0014_accounting_journal_core` | |
| ACCT-3 | Manual entry UI + retire income/expenses | Not started | — | |
| ACCT-4 | Financial reports (trial balance, income statement, balance sheet) | Not started | `0015_accounting_reports` | Runs before ACCT-5 — hence the lower migration number |
| ACCT-5 | Fixed assets & depreciation | Not started | `0016_accounting_fixed_assets` | |
| ACCT-6 | Historical import / opening balance | Blocked | `0017_accounting_opening_balance_adjustment` (conditional) | Needs Sinag's decision on: (1) ₱50,000 Owner's Capital vs Owner's Withdrawals reclass, (2) how to absorb ₱2,784.03 ledger imbalance. Migration only needed if a plug account is required. |
| ACCT-7 | Auto-posting from `confirm_order()` / PO receiving | Gated | `0018_accounting_order_posting` | Waiting on core BMS order/PO flow to stabilize — do not start until confirmed |
| ACCT-8 | BIR tax estimate calculator | Not started | — | Lowest priority, optional |

## Session log

*(Claude Code: append a dated entry here after each session — what was done, what was decided, anything left open.)*

### 2026-07-02 — ACCT-1

Applied migration `0013_accounting_chart_of_accounts` via Supabase MCP (`accounts` table, RLS: select admin+manager, insert/update admin-only, no delete policy per D003). Seeded all 95 accounts from the doc's corrected Chart of Accounts (including the `4014` Phone Stand fix and the 6 header-row exclusions).

Verified Definition of Done directly against the live DB:
- Category counts match exactly: 24 asset, 2 liability, 3 equity, 20 revenue, 46 expense (95 total)
- RLS confirmed via `SET LOCAL role authenticated` + `request.jwt.claims` impersonation (rolled back, no data changes): manager (`Maria Santos`) sees all 95 rows on select, insert is rejected by RLS; encoder (`Claude Code (Encoder Test)`) gets 0 rows on select
- `npm run build` passes (DB-only phase, no UI to build)

No open items. ACCT-2 (Journal Core) is next, per the doc's recommendation to run it with a higher-capability model given the correctness requirements.

### 2026-07-02 — ACCT-2

Applied migration `0014_accounting_journal_core` via Supabase MCP: tables `journal_entries` and `journal_entry_lines` (money columns `numeric(12,2)` per the module's deliberate deviation), four indexes, RLS **select-only** for admin+manager on both tables (no direct insert/update/delete — writes go exclusively through the RPC), and the `post_journal_entry(p_entry_date, p_description, p_lines jsonb, p_source_type, p_source_id)` `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC. Applied verbatim from the doc.

Verified Definition of Done directly against the live DB, all via `request.jwt.claims` role impersonation inside rolled-back transactions (no persisted test data — confirmed both tables back to 0 rows afterward):
- **Balanced entry** (Dr 1020 Bank 50,000 / Cr 3000 Owner's Capital 50,000) posts: 2 lines, debit=credit=50000.00, `line_order` [0,1], `created_by` = caller's uid, `source_type` = manual.
- **Unbalanced entry** rejected before any insert: `Entry does not balance: debits 50000 vs credits 49999`. No partial rows.
- **Invalid account** (9999) rejected before any insert: `Unknown or inactive account number(s): 9999`.
- **Encoder** (`Claude Code (Encoder Test)`) blocked: `Not authorized to post journal entries` (role check is the RPC's first statement).
- Bonus: manager (`Maria Santos`) can post; `journal_entry_lines_one_side` CHECK rejects a line with both debit and credit > 0.
- `get_advisors(security)`: `post_journal_entry` shows the same anon/authenticated "can execute SECURITY DEFINER" WARN as every existing project RPC (`confirm_order`, `adjust_stock`, `receive_purchase_order`) — the internal role check is the established gate; not a regression.
- `npm run build` passes.

Note on scope: the doc's ACCT-2 header said "Chart of Accounts" in the kickoff request, but ACCT-1 (Chart of Accounts) was already Done and ACCT-2 is Journal Core — processed ACCT-2 (Journal Core) only, as instructed ("Only ACCT-2 should be processed"). No git commit (per standing project rule — stopped at DoD for manual review). ACCT-3 (Manual Entry UI + retire income/expenses) is next but has open decisions requiring Sinag (Income/Expense category mappings, Rent/Transportation accounts).
